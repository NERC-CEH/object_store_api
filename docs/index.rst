Object Store API documentation
========================

This API is intended to simplify the creation and management of research data held in "object storage" - typically using s3, a de facto standard made popular by Amazon AWS, which the JASMIN data analysis facility makes freely available for research purposes.

See the `Object Store tutorial <https://github.com/NERC-CEH/object_store_tutorial/>`_ project for guidance and examples of working with the object storage in JASMIN.
